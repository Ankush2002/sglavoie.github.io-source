This website will aim to provide useful information while documenting my
journey as a learner in technology-related matters.
</p>

<p>
It will become a tech journal with the specific goal of explaining the
challenges that I will inevitably face while trying to become a better
student and most importantly, it will be a reference to the solutions
that I found along the way so that it can benefit others too.

<h2>Why yet another blog?</h2>
<p>If I'm being honest, the answer is fourfold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am being somewhat narcissistic in the process of writing an open
blog like this, writing about my own experience the whole time. However
my goal is really to make my learning stick around longer and as a
byproduct, I wish to share with the world interesting ideas and provide
some kind of support as a way to give back to the community. I could not
write about something that I do not know, so writing about my journey
seems quite fitting. Also, I would hope that with so many people in
the world, someone out there is going to find an answer that satisfies
his/her curiosity and I would be happy to contribute to advancing
someone else's plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a French Canadian speaker from Quebec and never really practiced
my English in order to reach an acceptable level of fluency, which is a
shame since it is one of the only two official languages in Canada! This
website, apart from being a reason to be accountable for my learning,
will hopefully improve my communication skills at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always enjoyed the written word and to this day, it remains my
favorite way of communicating meaningful things with others. I find
that having the ability to iterate over any word or sentence makes
for great punch lines and generates more impact in many situations. I
would say this is one of the reasons why I loved programming in the
first place: nothing remains the same forever because the freedom to
apply changes never goes away. You always have the chance to fix a
line of broken code, to modify a function or class, to add comments
and documentation, etc. I find it really comforting to think about
the endless possibilities that open up with this kind of activity.
Spontaneity is of course a wonderful aspect of being human, but the
mastery that can be achieved through perfecting an existing project
remains very satisfying because we never get it right the first time and
there is always room for improvement! Reading has become an intrinsic
part of me: it helps me reach my goals; it has been a precious ally when
dealing with bouts of depression; it has been a fantastic way of keeping
in touch with lost friends and family members and getting to know people
that I never had the luxury of meeting in person. Highly recommended <i

<p>I needed to find a way to get better at
using <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>/<a
href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a> as my main text editor and I figured
out that editing a lot of text could be a way to go.</p>
