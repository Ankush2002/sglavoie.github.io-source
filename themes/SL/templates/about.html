                    I'm SÃ©bastien Lavoie and I'm here to document my journey
                    as a learner in technology-related matters, explaining the
                    challenges that I face while trying to become a better
                    student. I teach the solutions that I find along the way so
                    that it can benefit others too.</p>

            <h2>Why yet another blog?</h2>
            <p>If I'm being honest, the answer is fourfold:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>I am being somewhat narcissistic in the process of writing an open
                    blog like this, writing about my own experience the whole time. However
                    my goal is really to make my learning stick around longer and as a
                    byproduct, I wish to share with the world interesting ideas and provide
                    some kind of support as a way to give back to the community. I could not
                    write about something that I do not know, so writing about my journey
                    seems quite fitting. Also, I would hope that with so many people in
                    the world, someone out there is going to find an answer that satisfies
                    his/her curiosity and I would be happy to contribute to advancing
                    someone else's plan.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I am a French Canadian speaker from Quebec and never really practiced
                    my English in order to reach an acceptable level of fluency, which is a
                    shame since it is one of the only two official languages in Canada! This
                    website, apart from being a reason to be accountable for my learning,
                    will hopefully improve my communication skills at the same time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I always enjoyed the written word and to this day, it remains my
                    favorite way of communicating meaningful things with others. I find
                    that having the ability to iterate over any word or sentence makes
                    for great punch lines and generates more impact in many situations. I
                    would say this is one of the reasons why I loved programming in the
                    first place: nothing remains the same forever because the freedom to
                    apply changes never goes away. You always have the chance to fix a
                    line of broken code, to modify a function or class, to add comments
                    and documentation, etc. I find it really comforting to think about
                    the endless possibilities that open up with this kind of activity.
                    Spontaneity is of course a wonderful aspect of being human, but the
                    mastery that can be achieved through perfecting an existing project
                    remains very satisfying because we never get it right the first time and
                    there is always room for improvement! Reading has become an intrinsic
                    part of me: it helps me reach my goals; it has been a precious ally when
                    dealing with bouts of depression; it has been a fantastic way of keeping
                    in touch with lost friends and family members and getting to know people
                    that I never had the luxury of meeting in person. Highly recommended <i

                <li>
                    <p>I needed to find a way to get better at
                    using <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>/<a
                             href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a> as my main text editor and I figured
                         out that editing a lot of text could be a way to go.</p>
