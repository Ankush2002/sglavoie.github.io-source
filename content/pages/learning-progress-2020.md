> Learning is an eternal path. I wanted to share my own adventure
> primarily for the following practical reasons: to help me remember
> what I have supposedly been working on technology-wise and
> to help me practice a technique that is known as [spaced
> repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
> This is really just a summary to motivate myself to keep on track,
> to practice consistent self-reflection and to be reminded as often
> as possible to stay a bit more humble, as it becomes obvious that I
> don't know much in the end. In the process, I hope you may find some
> inspiration too.
