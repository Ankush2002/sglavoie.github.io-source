> Learning is an eternal path. I wanted to share my own adventure
primarily for the following practical reasons: to help me remember
what I have supposedly been working on technology-wise and
to help me practice a technique that is known as [spaced
repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
This is really just a summary to motivate myself to keep on track,
to practice consistent self-reflection and to be reminded as often
as possible to stay a bit more humble, as it becomes obvious that I
don't know much in the end. In the process, I hope you may find some
inspiration too.
