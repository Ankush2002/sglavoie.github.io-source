> Learning is an eternal path. I wanted to share my own adventure
primarily for the following practical reasons: to help me remember
what I have supposedly been working on technology-wise and
to help me practice a technique that is known as [spaced
repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
This is really just a summary to motivate myself to keep on track and
be reminded as often as possible to stay a bit more humble, as it
becomes obvious that I don't know much in the end. In the process, I
hope you may find some inspiration too.
