Summary: I have been using a few different tools from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/) for a while and I must say that once everything is configured properly, they are a joy to use. Some tools, like **dmenu** and **slock**, seem simple on the surface, but they allow to simplify your workflow by quite a bit. Another one, **st**, is a truly fantastic and lightweight terminal!

## What are Suckless tools?

From the [official website](https://suckless.org/):

> Home of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/),
[dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) and other quality software
with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and frugality.

There are also other incredible pieces of software that are worth
mentioning, including [st](https://st.suckless.org/).

Here, I will only go over the tools I use frequently, but keep in mind
that everything from Suckless... Sucks less
